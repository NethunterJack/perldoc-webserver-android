The perldoc-webserver-android is a very basic webserver written in perl which
implements just the GET method of the HTTP 1.0 protocol and that too in a very
incomplete manner.

It is geared for one task and one task only: serve out perldoc pages as
downloaded from the perldoc website (http://perldoc.perl.org).

The genesis of the project was when I discovered that Opera mobile on my Toshiba
AC100 would not open perldoc pages from local storage. That is urls of the form
'file:///...' would not open in Opera, while they opened just fine on the
build-in android browser. So, spending an evening with Terminal Emulator, Opera
mobile, netcat, vim and perl from SL4A on a Toshiba AC100 travelling in a train
from Bangalore to Hyderabad for a wedding, I wrote up this webserver to allow me
to view perldoc locally.
